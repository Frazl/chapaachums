# Overview

Chapaa Chums is a Palia helper site. Palia is an online "cozy" MMO inspired by Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. It is developed by Singularity 6 and therefore many of the assets and content the site distributes is not owned by me or any contributor. **This tool / site is fan-made and not affiliated in any way with Palia or Singularity 6.**

I (Fraz / @Frazl) am open to contributions to the website, I'm interested in bug fixes / new features / suggestions (via issues tab on github or discord). I will try record any suggestions or issues on discord and keep that as the single source of truth to help non technical people contribute ideas ðŸ˜Š

# Technical

## Tech Stack

- This site is built using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) template with typescript. 
- I do not plan on adding Redux to this site 
- It makes use of the react-router for basic "page" routing
- It makes use of google sheets for persistence. I do not plan on changing this.

## Dev Setup

- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- A webpack dev server running on port 3000 will start with hot reloading, see the create-react-app bootstrap template for more info.

Issues? Contact Fraz on discord.
